Instructor: Sandip Kumar Agarwal
Course code: ECO301

Programming language used : Python
                            *Coding was done in google colab*

*'EducationinIndia_Report.pdf' is the report pdf.
*Check ‘project_eco301.ipynb’ for the code.  
*Use datasets ‘data_2016-17_statewise_dropout.csv’ and ‘data_2016-17_statewise.csv’ prepared from the ‘SRC_Rawdata_2016-17_Elementary’ dataset available in the DISE website. 
*For runing the code datasets ‘data_2016-17_statewise_dropout.csv’ and ‘data_2016-17_statewise.csv’ are enough.
*All the datasets are submitted in the zip file.
*Outputs of the code are already saved in the code and a separate folder of pictures of all the outputs "Graph Images" are also saved in the zip file.
*To execute the code use jupyter with the two datasets mentioned above with path changes in snippets 2 and 30 or directly upload and the file ‘project_eco301.ipynb’ to google colab and the two datasets mentioned above in the drive and use the path(where the datasets are stored in google drive) of the above two datasets in the code in snippets 2 and 30.
