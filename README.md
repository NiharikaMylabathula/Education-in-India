# Education-in-India
India is the second-most populous country after China, with a population of approximately 1.3 billion. So with a large population comes a colossal unemployment problem because the demand for skilled workers is high. In a country with a population this high, there is a high competition in the market as well. Hereâ€™s where Education plays a significant role.
The project focuses on the Literacy rate, Dropout rate and Gross Enrolment Ratio(GER), as in how many children, of age 15 and below, are enrolling to schools, across India. We used the most recent data available to us from the DISE site for 2016-17. The data contains a lot of information about schools, of all states, like the population in a particular district, sex ratio, male and female literacy rate, playground, electricity facility in the schools etc. The data is categorised into, government schools, private schools and unrecognised and madrasas. It also gives details of all girls, all boys or co-education schools and the facilities available in those schools. Please note that the used factors that affect the education system are all pointed out, in the dataset provided and other factors like political influences and government changes are not taken into account in this report.
